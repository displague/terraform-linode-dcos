# DC/OS Linode Installer

This Terraform module installs DC/OS on Linode Cloud infrastructure using the [Universal Installer](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/dcos-terraform/dcos-core/template/).

This is a Work-In-Progress and may not be very usable.

See the examples/ directory for instructions on running this and a demonstrative workload.
